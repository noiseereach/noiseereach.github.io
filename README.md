This is a beta client, Maybe it will be available to everyone. I just learned the 'code' to create a client (actually I skid :>).
JbyteMod, Eclipse IDE.
Working on a super weak windows 7 laptop and under my brother's computer management so I think it won't come out :(

NOTE: I "CODE" FROM FDP CLIENT (but it won't rat)
